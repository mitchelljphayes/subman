Hi there :smiley: <br>
This is the repo of Team MasterOfNone

How to run the project:

clone this repo
`git clone https://github.com/mitchelljphayes/subman.git`

move into the subman directory
`cd subman`

make sure you have pipenv installed using pip or pip3 depending on your system.
`$ pip install pipenv`

install from pipfile using pipenv
`$ pipenv install`

This should set up a local python environment inside your repo so we can all keep insync

If you install any dependencies make sure you do so via pipenv, so it gets added to the pipfile.
